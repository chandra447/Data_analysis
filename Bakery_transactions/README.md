*The above analysis give a deep understanding and measured to take for improving the service of the bakery.

Lets dive into what is present in the code.

## Transactions based on part of the day.

The first graph tells us on which part of the day there are more number of sales.

From the above graph it is clear that there are more number of transactions during Morning.

## Transaction analysis based on the hour of the day. 

The next analysis suggests during which hour of the day there more number of transactions.

As we can see that there are more number of transactions at around 11:00AM

From the above Pie chart we can see that *Coffee* is the most selling item.

## Item bought along with coffee
As we know that coffee is the most bought item let us check what is the most bought item along with coffee.
Just we are checking the conditional probability that occurrence of an item when coffee is bought.

As we can see that *Bread* has more probability than other items which means that there is high chance of buying Bread
when a person buys a coffee.

## Highest hour_Coffee is sold

We found that Coffee is most selling now let us check during which hour coffee is mostly being sold out.

![newplot-4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39896565/48604019-8a700f00-e9cc-11e8-8ce9-6a0cca6f8e53.png)

As we can see that *Coffee* is heavily sold out during 11:00AM

## Transactions per month_based

![newplot-5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39896565/48604424-f43ce880-e9cd-11e8-898a-b86c3eb05b4a.png)

The above chart shows the transaction fluctuation aver the months.

## Summary
1. The most sold item is coffee. Hence increasing the number
of coffee machines can make the bakery provide smooth service to the customers.
2. Mostly bread is bought with coffee hence placing the bread near to the
coffee pickup points or at coffee machines will result in increase in sales of bread.
3. Coffee is mostly bought during 11:00Am of the day
hence it would also be better to appoint extra baristas for smooth services.

**Looking into these solutions may increase the sales in bakery**
